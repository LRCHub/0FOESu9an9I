[00:18.25] Yo, ain't no leaders where I'm from, I gotta fly the flag
[00:22.17] So my brothers, them have got me 'til the final lap
[00:24.64] I feel like I'm floppin' when I try relax
[00:26.98] But it turned me to a boss because I like the graft
[00:29.48] Built a couple bridges over minor gaps
[00:31.63] Burnt a couple too, shit, I might struggle, but the time will pass
[00:34.13] Long way from playin' double up behind the flats
[00:36.84] Lookin' for some money, havin' trouble tryna find the bag
[00:39.69] Grew up with some snakes in the bits
[00:41.25] So make your bread, just be careful who you're breakin' it with
[00:43.65] Brothers hate when you're paid, girls as fake as their lips
[00:46.56] Everybody turn salty, gotta take you a pinch, yeah
[00:50.93] Raise my glass up in the air and go and smash it off the wall
[00:53.61] I don't wanna pour one up if you won't catch me when I fall
[00:56.07] Call me bro, but you still struggle lookin' at me when I talk
[01:01.66] Hide my feelings, everybody say I'm hard to read
[01:04.04] I got some problems, if I state, they wouldn't half believe
[01:06.36] Shit, they think it's all party, beats, and Cardi Bs
[01:08.81] I done lost a lot of love for the game
[01:10.81] Shit changed, plus I feel like it don't love me the same
[01:13.13] I might expect too much or it's just fucks with my brain
[01:15.74] I don't know, feels like I'm stuck in a maze
[01:17.57] Takes a lot to explain
[01:18.66] Die for my little sister tomorrow
[01:20.28] I'll go to jail for my broski and I won't feel a way
[01:22.98] Put my ends on the map, I had to open the gate
[01:25.39] Now they tag me post when they go down the lane
[01:28.71] God got me, mum, I know that you pray
[01:30.41] But I'm never far from home even though I'm away
[01:32.88] See the rosary beads you left me when I open my case
[01:35.20] From the roads to the road to be great, yeah
[01:38.53] Dad told me, "Find a craft and go and master it"
[01:40.56] Now he ain't gotta graft, he just relax and find a gaff to flip
[01:43.40] Some my family still on bag it up package it
[01:45.44] But some things never change, I'll put my cash in for the damages
[01:47.86] Still hungry like I need me a rack
[01:50.30] You know the bando in Manny, really bees in trap
[01:52.60] I lost friends for a second, thought I needed 'em back
[01:54.95] I never been more wrong, and shit, we'll leave it at that
[01:58.22] Took a break to get some shit up off my chest
[02:00.21] Stopped myself from postin', said I'm chillin' for a sec
[02:02.56] Told everyone I'm focused, said I need a little rest
[02:04.87] But if I'm honest, I just ghosted 'cause I split up with my ex
[02:07.89] Life was cozy, had to pick up where I left
[02:09.82] Booked a flight with couple brodies, took the business off my head
[02:12.54] Lyin' if I said I'm lonely, got my brothers to the death
[02:14.75] If I die, give all my Rollies to the thugs and let 'em flex
[02:19.94] Yeah, go on then
[02:20.80] I'll shou-, I'll th-, I'll shout you tomorrow, go for a scram tomorrow, innit?
[02:23.87] Go on
[02:24.76] Alright, respect, yeah
[02:25.69] Alright, I'll show you how to drive your SV 'round, man
[02:27.87] Hahaha, say no more
[02:31.32] Safe, fam
[02:32.43] Safe, yeah
[02:33.58] Safe, man
[02:34.38] Safe, man
[02:35.27] Haha
[02:37.43] It's hard followin' your brain when your soul don't care
[02:39.96] It still feels like no one's there
[02:42.79] Sittin' on my throne with an open stare
[02:44.92] 'Cause to me it's just a broken chair
[02:47.54] I love it at the top, but shit, it's cold up there
[02:49.86] I kinda found out how it feels to be alone up there
[02:52.41] Lookin' for some hope, it never showed up there
[02:54.69] But fuck it, I'm a soldier, I can cope up there
[02:57.27] Heart's numb, shit don't feel the same
[02:59.08] All the money in the world couldn't heal the pain
[03:01.69] All the honeys and the girls wanna deal with Aitch
[03:04.02] But they deal with him too if he steals my name
[03:07.42] Back then I used to pray they'd know me
[03:09.12] But shit ain't what I thought, sometimes it ain't so rosy
[03:11.41] Kick back and think as I burn my spliff
[03:13.94] Just block the world out and watch the day go slowly
[03:16.38] Ayy, knobhead, I need these receipts
[03:18.92] Rapido, you know?
[03:20.68] I've got a fuckin' Excel sheet in front of me, yeah
[03:22.58] You would not believe how much money you're throwin' away without fuckin' receipts
[03:26.51] Just get back to me please, if you don't mind?
[03:29.20] And in a bit
